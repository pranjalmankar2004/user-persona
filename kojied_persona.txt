USER PERSONA

**Name**: Kojied (generated)

**Age Range**: Not explicitly mentioned, possibly 20–35 based on context and subreddits.

**Occupation**: Mentions work/job

**Top Interests**:
- Anime
- Gaming

**Goals and Aspirations**: Not clear from data.

**Core Values and Beliefs**: At this point I've written off all my purchases as a loss. I think I had like 5k in it at some point, but I'm not even sure if I was able to take it out via ECOMI either :/

It's not just an veve issue, from BitClout to friendtech to Rally to NFTs in general, it's basically gone.

I'm treating it as a every expensive life lesson and will be much more cautious when a new hype begins

**Pain Points and Challenges**: It depends on who’s my neighbor, if they’re peaceful it’s not too hard, unless someone runs away on science. Try to pit them against each other by bribing them to go to war with each other, which might be easier if you have warmongering neighbors.

**Writing Style and Tone**: Informal, uses emoticons or internet slang

**Personality Traits**: Expressive

**Reddit Usage Behavior**: Prefers short comments/posts
